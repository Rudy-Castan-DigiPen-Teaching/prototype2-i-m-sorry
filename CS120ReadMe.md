## 1.    
Team members: SunWoo Lee, DaeHyeon Kim, HyoungWon Ahn    
Assignment name: Prototype #2    
Course name: CS120    
Term: Fall 2020    
## 2.    
We need to more learn about using the `constexpr` functions.
## 3.   
If we learn more in DigiPen, we might be able to make a simple mobile game with this idea.   
We tried that all team members were able to understand each other's ideas and code. So, we could advise with other member’s code to make better code and it was successful.   
## 4.    
Used C++ and `doodle` framework to make a game prototype - main.cpp, line 14    
Made good use of exceptions - main.cpp, line 78    
All functions, member functions and constructors validate their parameters - game.cpp, line 69    
Made good use of File IO with the `ifstream` and `ofstream` types - main.cpp, line 93, line 96    
Made good use of `std::map` and/or `std::unordered_map` - main_header.h, line 54    
Make good use of functions - main.cpp, line 90    
Make good use of `class`/`struct` - pos.h, line 7    
Make good use of References - arts.cpp, line 22    
All variables are initialized when **defined** - main_header.h, line 56    
If using shared global variables then they are defined in a header file with the `inline` keyword. - main_header.h, line 57    
Constants are defined as `constexpr` whenever possible - main_header.h, line 55    
Make good use of `using` statements - main_header.h, line 16    
Collection of variables are put into a struct or class object - game.h, line 12    
If using fixed size arrays then they are defined with `std::array` - menu.h, line 14    
Created and used your own `namespace` -main_header.h, line 19    
All long functions are broken down into helper functions - game.cpp, line 143    
Uses default arguments rather than function overloads - bullet.h, line 30, 31    
Made one more `constexpr` functions - main.cpp, line 84    
If functions are defined in header files then they are marked as `inline` or `constexpr` - main_header.h, line 20    
Window title contains team name - main.cpp, line 14    
**All** Source Code has a proper header comment: Name, Assignment Name, Course Number, Term & Year. - main.cpp, line 1
