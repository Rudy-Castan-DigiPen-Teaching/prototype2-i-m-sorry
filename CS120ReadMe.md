## 1.    
Team members: SunWoo Lee, DaeHyeon Kim, HyoungWon Ahn    
Assignment name: Prototype #2    
Course name: CS120    
Term: Fall 2020    
## 2.    
We need to more learn about using the `constexpr` functions.
## 3.   
If we learn more in DigiPen, we might be able to make a simple mobile game with this idea.   
We tried that all team members were able to understand each other's ideas and code. So, we could interfere with other member’s code to make better code and it was successful.   
## 4.    
- [x] [**core**] Used C++ and `doodle` framework to make a game prototype
- [x] [**core**] Code is reasonably organized across multiple files, so that there are no big monolithic source code files.
- [x] [**core**] Made good use of exceptions - main.cpp, line 78
- [x] [**core**] All functions, member functions and constructors validate their parameters - game.cpp, line 69
- [x] [**core**] Made good use of File IO with the `ifstream` and `ofstream` types main.cpp, line 93, line 96
- [x] [**core**] Made good use of `std::map` and/or `std::unordered_map` main_header.h, line 54
- [x] Uses the most appropriate loop statements for the kind loop that is done
- [x] Make good use of functions - main.cpp, line 90
- [x] Make good use of `class`/`struct` - pos.h, line 7
- [x] Make good use of References - arts.cpp, line 22
- [x] Print only debug info via `cout`
- [x] All variables are initialized when **defined** - main_header.h, line 56
- [x] If using shared global variables then they are defined in a header file with the `inline` keyword. - main_header.h, line 57
- [x] Constants are defined as `constexpr` whenever possible - main_header.h, line 55
- [x] Make good use of `using` statements - main_header.h, line 16
- [x] Collection of variables are put into a struct or class object - game.h, line 12
- [x] If using fixed size arrays then they are defined with `std::array` 
- [x] Created and used your own `namespace` -main_header.h, line 19
- [x] All long functions are broken down into helper functions - game.cpp, line 143
- [x] Uses default arguments rather than function overloads
- [x] Made one more `constexpr` functions - main.cpp, line 84
- [x] If functions are defined in header files then they are marked as `inline` or `constexpr` - main_header.h, line 20
- [x] Window title contains team name - main.cpp, line 14
- [x] All source files compile without warnings and without errors.
- [x] Warning level 4 is set and treat warnings as errors is set.
- [x] Correct files submitted. No unnecessary files submitted.
- [x] **All** Source Code has a proper header comment: Name, Assignment Name, Course Number, Term & Year.
- [x] Followed the appropriate Code Quality Guidelines and Code Style Guidelines.
- [x] Created a properly filled out `CS120ReadMe.md` file
- [x] All requirements that are completed are checked off here by replacing the `[ ]` with `[x]`
