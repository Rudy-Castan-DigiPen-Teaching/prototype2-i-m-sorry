Used C++ and `doodle` framework to make a game prototype - main.cpp, line 14    
Made good use of exceptions - main.cpp, line 78    
All functions, member functions and constructors validate their parameters - game.cpp, line 69    
Made good use of File IO with the `ifstream` and `ofstream` types main.cpp, line 93, line 96    
Made good use of `std::map` and/or `std::unordered_map` main_header.h, line 54    
Uses the most appropriate loop statements for the kind loop that is done - game.cpp, line 129    
Make good use of functions - main.cpp, line 90    
Make good use of `class`/`struct` - pos.h, line 7    
Make good use of References - arts.cpp, line 22    
All variables are initialized when **defined** - main_header.h, line 56    
If using shared global variables then they are defined in a header file with the `inline` keyword. - main_header.h, line 57    
Constants are defined as `constexpr` whenever possible - main_header.h, line 55    
Make good use of `using` statements - main_header.h, line 16    
Collection of variables are put into a struct or class object - game.h, line 12    
If using fixed size arrays then they are defined with `std::array` - menu.h, line 14    
Created and used your own `namespace` -main_header.h, line 19    
All long functions are broken down into helper functions - game.cpp, line 143    
Uses default arguments rather than function overloads - bullet.h, line 26, 27    
Made one more `constexpr` functions - main.cpp, line 84    
If functions are defined in header files then they are marked as `inline` or `constexpr` - main_header.h, line 20    
Window title contains team name - main.cpp, line 14    
**All** Source Code has a proper header comment: Name, Assignment Name, Course Number, Term & Year. - main.cpp, line 1
